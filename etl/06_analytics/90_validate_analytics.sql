-- ============================================================
-- Analytics gate
--
-- Stage:     06 Analytics validation
-- Runs after: the three analytics datasets
-- Target:    `ftw-week-08`.`01-control`.data_quality_results
-- Grain:     one row per check per run
-- Contract:  docs/validation.md (shared result contract, D17)
--
-- Dashboards use validated Analytics results only.
--
-- The spot checks recompute a single cell straight from fact_taxi_trip and
-- compare it with what the dataset published. That is the hand-calculation
-- the acceptance evidence asks for, written so it reruns on every load
-- instead of being done once by hand and trusted afterwards.
-- ============================================================

-- The Gold gate reports one dataset per table, not a single 'gold' dataset, so
-- this requires at least one Gold row to exist and none of them to be failing.
-- Zero rows means the gate never ran, which is not the same as passing.
