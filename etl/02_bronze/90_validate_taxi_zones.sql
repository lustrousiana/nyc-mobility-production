-- Bronze gate: Taxi Zones
--
-- Stage:     02 Bronze validation
-- Runs after: etl/02_bronze/30_load_taxi_zones.sql
-- Target:    `ftw-week-08`.`01-control`.data_quality_results
-- Grain:     one row per check per run
-- Contract:  docs/validation.md (shared result contract, D17)
--
-- Replaces the results table `02-bronze`.90_validate_taxi_zones, which
-- began with a digit (D13) and sat in a business schema. Silver
-- taxi_zones runs only when this passes.
--
-- The source path is repeated here on purpose: reconciliation must
-- re-read the file independently of what the loader recorded about it.
