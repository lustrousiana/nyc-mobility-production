-- ============================================================
-- Integration gate
--
-- Stage:     04 Integration validation
-- Runs after: etl/04_integration/20_resolve_trip_weather.sql
-- Target:    `ftw-week-08`.`01-control`.data_quality_results
-- Grain:     one row per check per run
-- Contract:  docs/validation.md (shared result contract, D17)
--
-- The first stage that needs every source, so it opens by asserting all
-- three Silver gates passed rather than trusting run order. Gold runs only
-- when this passes.
--
-- Unmatched counts are recorded as INFO measurements, not failures: a trip
-- to an unknown zone or an hour with no weather is a real fact about the
-- data, and the requirement is that it be COUNTED before a join type is
-- chosen, not that it be zero. What blocks is fan-out, a changed grain, an
-- ambiguous weather match, or a status outside its documented domain.
-- ============================================================

-- Dependency assertion. COALESCE matters: a gate that has never run has no
-- row in gate_status at all, and without it NULL <> 'PASS' is NULL, so the
-- check would pass silently on a source that was never validated.
